                <p>
                    "Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance."

<br>Steven Pressfield’s The War of Art is a mind shifting book that tells us how to start, how to continue and how to get to the end. It doesn’t matter what we’re doing—maybe one of us is trying to write a book, another is trying to draw, and someone else is building a startup—but we all face the same invisible force within ourselves. This book is for those people. It helps us overcome that invisible force called "Resistance". 

<br>It has three part. Firstly, Resistance: Defining the Enemy, which explains the way we ourselves stop us from doing what we want to do. Secondly, Combating Resistance: Turning Pro, which explains how to be a professional. And finally Beyond Resistance: Higher Realms, which goes through our spiritual side of creativity and inspiration.

<br>
The War of Art is a good and short written book, that doesn't help you to create but helps you to show up everyday and continue to the end of what you are doing despite of fear, distraction, or self-sabotage.
<br>
"There’s no mystery to turning pro. It’s a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our minds to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that."

<br>Rating: 4/5

                    "Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life."
                    <br>
                    If you are going through any mental crisis because of death of any of your close one this book is for you. It's a novel that tells you how death, memory, friendship and love can manipulate ones life. Though the tone of the book is quite depressing but at the end you might feel free.
                    <br>
                    The story is very engaging. Once you start reading the story keeps you inside until you finish it. Set in 1960s Tokyo, the novel follows Toru Watanabe, a college student. It  navigates the complexities of his young adulthood and the emotional weight of those he loves. Exploiting through different shades of love, Murakami wrote a very hauntingly beautiful novel.

                    "Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for them to be hurt. Life is like that."

                <h4 class="poemTitle">The Obstacle Is the Way</h4>
                <p>
                    "Every obstacle is unique to each of us. But the responses they elicit are the same: Fear. Frustration. Confusion. Helplessness. Depression. Anger."
                    <br>
                    Inspired by many great personalities like Barack Obama, Rockefeller, and Einstein, as well as ancient thinkers like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus, Ryan Holiday wrote a very good and mind-shifting book to inspire people overwhelmed by their obstacles. In this book, he illustrates how three principles—perception, action, and will—can help us turn adversity, which brings us down, into our advantage. The most engaging thing about this book is the use of real-world examples of people who have faced similar problems, stood against them, and converted them into strengths. So, everyone who may be seeking mental toughness or struggling with life’s obstacles should read this.
                    <br>
                    "Not everyone looks at obstacles—often the same ones you and I face—and sees reason to despair. In fact, they see the opposite. They see a problem with a ready solution. They see a chance to test and improve themselves. Nothing stands in their way. Rather, everything guides them on the way."

                <h4 class="poemTitle">Animal Firm</h4>
                <p>
                    “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”
                    <br>
                    George Orwell's Animal Farm was first published in 1945 on the relevance of the Russian Revolution and Stalin’s rise to power. But the book lost its power to keep that relevance for any fixed period of time. Even now, you will find every bit of it relevant, especially the people of Bangladesh. The way Orwell explored power, corruption, and propaganda made the book a timeless political satire.
                    <br>
                    The story takes place at an animal farm named Manor Farm, where the animals revolt against their oppressive master and build a society where everyone will have equal rights. But with time, a new hierarchy is built with the same tyranny they tried to remove.
                    <br>
                    Though at the start, when you find animals talking, you may think of it as a childish book. But as the story moves forward, you see how it explores politics, society, and human nature in a satirical way and creates a view of the political events occurring around you.
                    <br>
                    "Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which."

                <h4 class="poemTitle">Man's Search for Meaning</h4>
                <p>
                    "A man's suffering is similar to the behaviour of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the "size" of human suffering is absolutely relative."
                    <br>
                    Viktor Frankl was one of the survivors of the holocaust and Man’s Search for Meaning is a book of his where he shared about his experiences in the concentration camp of Auschwitz. But he didn't just shared some historical records in this book. He also explored how individuals can find meaning even during unimaginable suffering. He divided the book in two parts. The second part is theoretical which gives a nutshell of logotherapy, his psychological theory that emphasizes finding purpose as a key to enduring hardship, whereas the first part is a story of his experiences that serves as  the existential validation of his theories.
                    <br>
                    This book can be sent to the genre of memoir but unlike many memoirs, it goes through the psychological aspects of survival rather than just the events themselves. It challenges it's readers to rethink their approach to suffering. People who are interested in psychology, philosophy, or personal growth should read this. Fans of existential thinkers like Nietzsche and Camus will also find it thought-provoking. More than just a historical account, Man’s Search for Meaning can work as one's guide to resilience, purpose and the power of the human spirit. 
                    <br>
                    "Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfil the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual."
